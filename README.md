# Track

Version 0.0.1

Track is a simple stock control system built using Django. I initially developed it to manage my employer's tablet stock, then later adapted it to handle the issuing of items (such as tablets) to delegates at conferences.

My employer, [Lumi Technologies Limited](http://www.lumiinsight.com/), has kindly allowed me to release Track under the MIT License. Please see LICENSE for further details.
